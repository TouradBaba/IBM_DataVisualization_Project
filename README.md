# Automobile Sales Visualization Project

## Overview
This project analyzes historical automobile sales data to understand market trends and dynamics. It includes a Jupyter Notebook for in-depth data exploration and visualization using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium libraries. Additionally, it features a Python script that creates an interactive dashboard using the Dash framework for exploring automobile sales statistics.

## Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook delves into the analysis of historical automobile sales data using various visualization techniques. Here's what you'll find inside:

- **Objective**: Outlines the goals of the analysis.
- **Data Exploration**: Provides an overview of the dataset, including its variables and structure.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - **Line Charts**: Visualizes automobile sales trends over the years to identify patterns and fluctuations.
  - **Scatter Plots**: Examines relationships between variables such as consumer confidence, vehicle price, and sales volume.
  - **Bar Charts**: Compares sales trends across different vehicle types and during recession periods.
  - **Bubble Plot**: Illustrates the impact of seasonality on automobile sales.
  - **Pie Charts**: Displays the distribution of advertising expenditure and vehicle types during recession and non-recession periods.
  - **Folium Map**: Creates a geographical map showing the highest sales regions/offices of the company during recession periods.
- **Insights**: Offers interpretations and insights derived from the visualizations, helping stakeholders understand the market dynamics better.

## Dash Web App
The Python script creates an interactive dashboard using the Dash framework, providing a user-friendly interface for exploring automobile sales statistics. Here's what the dashboard offers:

- **Dashboard Features**:
  - **Yearly Statistics**: Visualizes yearly automobile sales trends using line charts, enabling users to observe long-term patterns.
  - **Recession Period Statistics**: Presents various statistics related to automobile sales during recession periods, including average sales, advertising expenditure, and unemployment rate effects.
- **Interactivity**: Users can interact with the dashboard to explore data dynamically, facilitating customized analysis and insights extraction.
